# Hatlab RFSoC control package for SC qubit experiments 

This is written based on the (awesome) QICK package (https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick)
, with some small modifications and addons including:
1. Loading/saving experiment configs in YAML files.
2. AveragerPrograms that provides simplified functions for writing qick programs.
3. Data saving and experiment manager classes/functions that fits in the plottr (https://github.com/toolsforexperiments/plottr) ddh5 format. 


## Get Started
1. Install the package
2. Copy the msmt_scripts folder to your project folder and start from there. The msmt_scripts 
   folder contains example qubit measurement scripts and templates of the YAML config files.
